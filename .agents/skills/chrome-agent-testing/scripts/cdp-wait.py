"""Block until a CDP event matching a predicate appears in an attach stream.

Replicates the *timing* of Claude Code's Monitor tool for agents that have no
Monitor capability. The agent backgrounds `chrome-agent attach ... > events.jsonl`
once, then makes ONE blocking call to this script per event it cares about.
Control returns the instant the event lands -- no fixed sleeps, no poll loops
burning agent turns.

What this does and does not replicate:

  Monitor      : events interject while the agent works on something else.
                 Concurrent. The agent is interrupted.
  This script  : the agent blocks on a wait that returns when the event fires.
                 Sequential. The agent is not interrupted, but it also never
                 sleeps too long or wakes too early.

The file is polled internally at a fine granularity, but that is the point:
the polling happens inside one tool call instead of costing the agent a turn
per check.

Exit codes:
  0  matched  -- the event JSON is printed to stdout
  1  timed out
  2  usage / stream error
